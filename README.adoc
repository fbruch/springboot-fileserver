= springboot-fileserver

Desktop File Server being realized with Java and Spring Boot.

== Goals

. Personal Reference Project for Spring Boot
. Backend for upcoming Desktop Data Management Application

== Status (Alpha)

* No installable build, no license selected
* Serving all files from configured directory roots
* Simple explorer-like navigation into document roots ("boxes" and their sub-directories to support interactive testing
* Mime-type detection using Apache Tika
* HTTP-Header for file-based metadata
* Automatic rendering of Markdown and Asciidoctor to HTML

=== Test / Development

* Java 21, Maven 3.6
* Configure document roots in `application-run.yml`
** Defaults to roots `demo` and `doc` below `src/test/resources`
* Start using `buildnrun.sh` (or `buildnrun.cmd` respectively)
* Point your browser to `http://localhost:8001`

== Future

=== Milestone 1 (Read Only, Plain Text, Markup Rendering)
* Serving text files with mimetype and file-based metadata
* Explicit and implicit metadata for files and directories
* Automatic rendering of markdown and asciidoctor to html
* Serving metadata for directories (content) to enable client implementations (json, HATEOAS)
* Experimental: Full text search

=== Milestone 2 (Binary files)

* Documents, Music, Images, Videos
* Extracting text from office documents
* Creating PDF files from text or markup
* Content-based metadata (id3, exif, ...)
* Streaming large files

=== Milestone 3 (Create/Update/Delete, Version History)

* Create new files, update or delete existing files
* Experimental: Automatic Version Control using git

=== Potential Future Milestones (Multi-User Server-Usage)

* Authentication
* Authorization
* Sharing, Collaborative editing
